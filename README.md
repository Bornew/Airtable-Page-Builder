# Page Builder app
Use this page builder app in your airtable base to write a Markdown passage using existing records in your table.
Simply specify the table, select the cell and add it into the page. 

This app will automatically transfer the format into Markdown, which enables you to export a Markdown page.

Perfect when you want to join pieces of information stored in your records into a long passage (e.g., when you want to write an essay based on multiple reading notes stored in your airtable base).
